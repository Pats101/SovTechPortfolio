# SovTechPortfolio

Forgive me for I ran out of time to complete this assignment. This is my first react js app that I created and given the time I could only do so much. I hope I will still get a chance to proceed with the interviews. I learnt a lot and it was a wonderful expeirence.

The project was deployed onto GitHub pages. You will find the link attached in the email to the live view.
